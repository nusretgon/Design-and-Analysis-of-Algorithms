## I have Design and Analysis of Algorithms class this semester and I will share my works. I hope this repo will be good for me and for you.

What is an algorithm ?

An algorithm is a sequence of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem. **The same algorithm can be represented in several different ways.**

We will focus on these methods; 

Brute-Force, Divide and Conquer,Decrease and Conquer, Transform and Conquer, Dynamic Programming and Greedy Technique.
